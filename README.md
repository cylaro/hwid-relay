**Connect as many devices as you want to a panel with a HWID device limit — they all count as one device.**

A self-hosted relay on Cloudflare Workers (free plan). Your apps subscribe to the relay; the relay downloads the real subscription with one fixed device identity. The panel sees a single device — no matter how many phones, PCs or TVs you connect. Works with stock apps: Happ, v2RayTun, Streisand, Karing, FlClashX, and anything else that loads a subscription by URL.

## How it works (30 seconds)

Panels like [Remnawave](https://docs.rw/features/hwid-device-limit) count unique `x-hwid` header values per user. Every app generates its own value and cannot change it — so ten apps become ten devices.

The relay changes where your apps connect:

```
Phone 1 (Happ) ─┐
Phone 2 (Happ) ─┤   https://your-worker.workers.dev/<secret>/s/<token>
Phone 10     ─┘              │
                             ▼   fixed identity: ONE x-hwid, ONE User-Agent
                    Your Cloudflare Worker
                             │
                             ▼
                  Panel  ──>  sees exactly ONE device
```

## Step-by-step guide

### Before you start

You need:

1. **Your current subscription link** — the panel URL with your personal token, for example:
   `https://panel-provider.com/sub/6f9a2b1c-4e7d-4c1a-9b2e-8f5d3a7c1e2f`
   If you only have an encrypted `happ://crypt5/...` link, decrypt it first with [happ-decryptor](https://github.com/cylaro/happ-decryptor).
2. **A free Cloudflare account** — [dash.cloudflare.com](https://dash.cloudflare.com) → Sign up. No card required.
3. **5 minutes.**

### Step 1 — Deploy the worker

1. Press the **Deploy to Cloudflare** button above (or create a Worker manually: dash.cloudflare.com → **Workers & Pages** → **Create** → **Create Worker**).
2. Name it, for example `hwid-relay`, and finish the deployment.

You now have a worker at `https://hwid-relay.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev`.

### Step 2 — Understand your subscription link

Split your link into two parts:

```
https://panel-provider.com/sub/6f9a2b1c-4e7d-4c1a-9b2e-8f5d3a7c1e2f
└────────── PANEL_BASE ──────────┘ └──────────── TOKEN ────────────┘
```

You will paste `PANEL_BASE` into the worker and `TOKEN` into every device link later.

### Step 3 — Choose the device identity

These values are what the panel will see as "the device":

| Field | Rule | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `HWID` | 10–64 chars: `A-Z a-z 0-9 = -` | `UE42LJXu4DbiCaBv` |
| `USER_AGENT` | any string, ideally matching a real client | `Happ/1.16.0 (iOS 18.3; iPhone 14 Pro)` |
| `DEVICE_OS` | `iOS`, `Android`, `Windows`, `macOS`… | `iOS` |
| `VER_OS` | OS version | `18.3` |
| `DEVICE_MODEL` | device name | `iPhone 14 Pro` |

You can generate a random valid HWID with the [happ-decryptor](https://github.com/cylaro/happ-decryptor) editor (`+ HWID` button). Once chosen, keep these values **the same forever** — the panel remembers the device by them.

### Step 4 — Set the worker variables

In the Cloudflare dashboard:

1. **Workers & Pages** → `hwid-relay` → **Settings** → **Variables and Secrets**.
2. Add each variable below with type **Text**, pressing **Deploy** at the end:

| Name | Value |
|---|---|
| `PANEL_BASE` | `https://panel-provider.com/sub` |
| `HWID` | `UE42LJXu4DbiCaBv` |
| `USER_AGENT` | `Happ/1.16.0 (iOS 18.3; iPhone 14 Pro)` |
| `SECRET_PREFIX` | a random word, e.g. `hX7kQ2mV` |
| `DEVICE_OS` | `iOS` |
| `VER_OS` | `18.3` |
| `DEVICE_MODEL` | `iPhone 14 Pro` |

Saving variables redeploys the worker automatically.

### Step 5 — Health check

Open:

```
https://hwid-relay.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev/hX7kQ2mV/health
```

Expected answer:

```json
{"status":"ok","hint":"subscription URL: <worker>/SECRET_PREFIX/s/<token>"}
```

If you get `{"status":"misconfigured",...}` — the response lists exactly which variables are missing or invalid.

### Step 6 — Check that the panel accepts your identity

Open in any browser:

```
https://hwid-relay.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev/hX7kQ2mV/s/6f9a2b1c-4e7d-4c1a-9b2e-8f5d3a7c1e2f
```

You should see the subscription content (a text list of `vless://...` lines, Base64, or similar). This proves the panel accepted your HWID — the relay always sends exactly these headers.

Also check the panel user card (your provider's website or mini-app): the device list should now show **one device** with your `DEVICE_MODEL`.

Alternative check: [happ-decryptor](https://github.com/cylaro/happ-decryptor) → Request tab → send the panel URL with the same values and inspect the response headers.

### Step 7 — Connect your devices

In each app (Happ, v2RayTun, ...): add a subscription by URL:

```
https://hwid-relay.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev/hX7kQ2mV/s/6f9a2b1c-4e7d-4c1a-9b2e-8f5d3a7c1e2f
```

That's it. Update the subscription on every device — the panel still shows one device. Traffic quota display works too (`subscription-userinfo` is forwarded).

> **Do not share the relay link publicly** — anyone with it uses your traffic under your identity.

### Maintenance

| Event | Action |
|---|---|
| Provider issued a new token | Add the new device link with the new token |
| Provider moved the panel | Update `PANEL_BASE`, devices untouched |
| Want a different identity | Change `HWID`/`USER_AGENT`, then update the subscription on all devices |

---

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `/health` returns `{"status":"misconfigured","missing":[...]}` | A variable is missing or invalid | Fix the listed variable in Step 4 |
| Subscription opens, but `x-hwid-max-devices-reached: true` in response headers | The limit is already used by earlier devices | Delete old devices in the panel user card, or ask the owner to raise the limit |
| Panel returns 404 or empty body | Wrong `PANEL_BASE`/token, the provider blocks Cloudflare IPs, or the panel requires an identity you did not configure | Open the original panel URL in a browser; if it works there, re-check your variables; if the provider blocks datacenter IPs, a relay on Cloudflare cannot help |
| `Not Found` from the worker | Wrong path or wrong `SECRET_PREFIX` | Use exactly `<worker>/<SECRET_PREFIX>/s/<token>` |
| Apps show no traffic quota | Panel does not send `subscription-userinfo` | Panel-side; not a relay issue |

## Honest limitations

- The panel sees one device whose requests come from Cloudflare IP ranges at a high frequency. A provider can notice this in server logs; using it against your plan's terms is your decision.
- If the provider blocks datacenter IPs, this relay cannot help — no free public service can fix that.
- One worker = one panel + one identity. Several panels → deploy the worker several times.

## Development

```bash
npm test            # unit tests: routing, headers, response filtering
npx wrangler dev    # run the worker locally
```
